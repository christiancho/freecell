# Freecell

The aim of this assessment is to use the RSpec files to guide your development. The assessment does *not* test your implementation, but the intended behavior of the methods required.

### Getting Started

Once you download the skeleton, run `bundle install`. You can then run the RSpec by running `bundle exec rspec`.

To run specific tests, add a line number like so: `bundle exec rspec spec/card_spec.rb:16`

### Special rules of this version of the game.

* ANY card may be placed onto an empty tableau.
* Cards CANNOT be moved from the foundation pile.
